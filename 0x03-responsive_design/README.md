Contains code for Responsive Design

02-1-styles.css

============================================
Whatever the browser you use, it’s a good idea from now on, to toggle the device view.

In a normal situation, you should start with “mobile first” in mind and write your CSS first for the mobile. But because we already have a desktop version, we will exceptionally add some media-queries for mobile and tablet.

    For extra large devices (no media queries)
    For desktop / large devices (max-width: 992px)
    For tablet / medium styles (max-width: 767px)
    For mobile styles (max-width: 480px)

We will put media queries at the end of each section to facilitate the reading but for performance reasons, the best practice is to unifiy all similar breakpoints at the end of the CSS file.

In your 02-1-styles.css file:

    inside the /* Helpers section target all images inside the main section
        Property: width, Value: 100%
        Property: height, Value: auto

    inside the /* Section Latest news section, add a new media query (max-width: 767px)
        Target the row inside section-latest-news
            Property: flex-direction, Value: column

    inside the /* Grid section, at the end, add a new media query (max-width: 767px)
        First, redefine the variable section-padding and give that value: 5rem 1.5rem. And redefine the variable section-body-padding with 2rem 0 0
        Target the ul.row and the row class
            Property: flex-direction, Value: column
            Property: margin, Value: 0
        Target all the classes that started with col-
            Property: margin, Value: 0 0 3rem 0
        Target the col-1-3 and col-1-2 classes
            Property: width, Value: 100%

The navbar is not allowing the website to fit the window. We will temporarily hide it and create a mobile navbar later.

    inside the /* Navbar section, at the end, add a new media query (max-width: 767px)
        Target the navbar-menu class
            Property: display, Value: none

You should now be able to easily view the website on a device of any screen/window size. I guess you are surprised that was so easy?!

04-index.html && 04-styles.html

========================================================

We want to have a clickable icon that shows and hide our navigation. We don’t want to use JavaScript but find a pure HTML / CSS way. We learned that input type checkbox have a checked - unchecked state. So we are going to use this for our menu.

Using the previous files as the base for this project

Changes to the HTML

Just before the <nav class="navbar-menu">

    Create an input (which will be not visible)
        Class: menu-btn
        Type: checkbox
        Id: menu-btn

    Create a label
        Class: menu-icon
        For: menu-btn
        In the label create an empty span with the navicon class.

Changes to the CSS

Inside the /* Navbar section, and inside the 767px media query

    Create the root global selector. We want to override a CSS variable:
        Variable name: nav-item-margin, Value: 0

    In the selector for the navbar-menu class
        Property: flex, Value: 1

    Target the nav class in header class
        Property: flex-direction, Value: column (for the element of the menu be below each other)
        Property: overflow, Value: hidden
        Property: max-height, Value: 0 (the display property can’t be animated, so we use the height that can be animated)
        Property: transition, Value: max-height .2s ease-out
